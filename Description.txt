Mass Filename Case Changer

Mass Filename Case Changer is a very basic program that simply changes the case of all filenames in a specified folder. File names can be changed to either uppercase, lowercase or title case. By default file extensions are forced to lowercase, but an option is available to leave them untouched. Note that the folder search is recursive in nature.

Update: The application now allows for the renaming of folders as well.
